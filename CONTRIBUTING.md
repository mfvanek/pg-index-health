## Building and testing

Java >= 11 is required.

1. Clone the repository

       git clone --recursive https://github.com/mfvanek/pg-index-health.git
       cd pg-index-health

2. Build with Gradle
    * On Linux and macOS: `./gradlew build`
    * On Windows: `.\gradlew.bat build`
    
   This will build the project and run tests.  
   **You need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) up and running**.
    
By default, [PostgreSQL 17.4 from Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) is used to run tests.  
Set `TEST_PG_VERSION` environment variable to use any of other available PostgreSQL version:
```
TEST_PG_VERSION=11.20-alpine
```
List of all available PostgreSQL versions can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

## Implementing a new check

### Write a new SQL query (pg-index-health-sql repository)

Each database structure check starts with an SQL query to the [pg_catalog](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalogs.html).

1. SQL queries for checks are located in a separate repository https://github.com/mfvanek/pg-index-health-sql
2. That repository is pulled into the current project as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
3. [SQLFluff](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) is used as a linter for all sql queries
4. All queries must be schema-aware (see [example](https://github.com/mfvanek/pg-index-health-sql/blob/6a5b823d2f86f3fed946f073de93a20245b8d312/sql/duplicated_indexes.sql#L23))

### Update git submodule

After your PR with a new sql query is merged, you need to update git submodule:

```shell
  git submodule foreach --recursive git pull origin master
```

### Extend domain model (if needed)

pg-index-health is a [multimodule Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html) project.  
Domain model is located in a [pg-index-health-model](pg-index-health-model).
All domain classes should be minimalistic and well-defined.
They should include enough information to generate corrective SQL migrations via [pg-index-health-generator](pg-index-health-generator).

### Add the code for the new check

#### Execution on a specific host

* [Checks on a specific host](pg-index-health-core/src/main/java/io/github/mfvanek/pg/core/checks/host)

Implement a new class extending [AbstractCheckOnHost](pg-index-health-core/src/main/java/io/github/mfvanek/pg/core/checks/host/AbstractCheckOnHost.java).

#### Execution on the cluster

* [Checks on the cluster](pg-index-health/src/main/java/io/github/mfvanek/pg/health/checks/cluster)

Implement a new class extending [AbstractCheckOnCluster](pg-index-health/src/main/java/io/github/mfvanek/pg/health/checks/cluster/AbstractCheckOnCluster.java).

### Write proper tests

* Your code must be 100% covered.
* Mutation tests via [pitest](https://pitest.org/) should work.
* Behavior of new check should be tested for partitioned tables.
* Behavior of new check should be tested with [quoted identifiers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS).

### Further steps

1. Update readme and add information about the new check
2. Update [Spring Boot starter](spring-boot-integration%2Fpg-index-health-test-starter).
3. Add sample code to the demo apps ([first](https://github.com/mfvanek/pg-index-health-demo/tree/master/pg-index-health-demo-without-spring), [second](https://github.com/mfvanek/pg-index-health-demo/tree/master/pg-index-health-spring-boot-demo)).
   Use a locally built pg-index-health version and send a draft PR.
